     <h2>We care about the environment just as you do. Our Founder, Allen Wat, has created a cleaning solution that is 100% environmentally friendly and produces zero waste. If we can create a new solution why can’t we create a new way to clean cars? This was the thought that started LAVO. Instead of you going to the car wash let the car wash come to you. With LAVO, we travel to your car and wash it. Busy all day working?  Need more family time? Not a problem, schedule an <a href="frmNewRequest1.aspx"> APPOINTMENT </a>and we will clean your car while you worry about things that require your attention.</h2>
